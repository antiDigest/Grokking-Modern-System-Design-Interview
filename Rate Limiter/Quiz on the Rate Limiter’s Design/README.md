## How will we design a rate limiter?
In the following lessons, we will learn about the following:

1. [Requirements](../Requirements%20of%20a%20Rate%20Limiter’s%20Design/): This is where we discuss the functional and non-functional requirements of the rate limiter. We also describe the types of throttling and locations where a rate limiter can be placed to perform its functions efficiently.
2. [High-level design](../Design%20of%20a%20Rate%20Limiter/): In this section, we look at the high-level design to provide an overview of a rate limiter.
3. [Detailed design](../Design%20of%20a%20Rate%20Limiter/): In this section, we discuss the detailed design of a rate limiter and explain various building blocks involved in the detailed design.
4. [Rate limiter algorithms](../Rate%20Limiter%20Algorithms/): In this lesson, we explain different algorithms that play a vital role in the operations of a rate limiter.
5. [Quiz](../Quiz%20on%20the%20Rate%20Limiter’s%20Design/): To assess your understanding of rate limiters, we’ve provided a quiz at the end of this chapter.
In the next lesson, let’s start by understanding the requirements and design of a rate limiter.
