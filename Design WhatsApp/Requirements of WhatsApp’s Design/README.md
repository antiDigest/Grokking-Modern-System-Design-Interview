# Requirements of WhatsApp’s Design
## Requirements
Our design of the WhatsApp messenger should meet the following requirements.

### Functional requirements
- Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.

- Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.

- Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.

- Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.

- ush notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.

### Non-functional requirements
- Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.

- Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent. Moreover, users must see the same chat history on all of their devices.

- Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.

- Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.

## Resource estimation
WhatsApp is the most used messaging application across the globe. According to WhatsApp, it supports more than two billion users around the world who share more than 100 billion messages each day. We need to estimate the storage capacity, bandwidth, and number of servers to support such an enormous number of users and messages.


### Storage estimation
As there are more than 100 billion messages shared per day over WhatsApp, let’s estimate the storage capacity based on this figure. Assume that each message takes 100 Bytes on average. Moreover, the WhatsApp servers keep the messages only for 30 days. So, if the user doesn’t get connected to the server within these days, the messages will be permanently deleted from the server.

100 billion/day∗100 Bytes=10 TB/day

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

30∗10 TB/day=300 TB/month

Besides chat messages, we also have media files, which take more than 100 Bytes per message. Moreover, we also have to store users’ information and messages’ metadata—for example, time stamp, ID, and so on. Along the way, we also need encryption and decryption for secure communication. Therefore, we would also need to store encryption keys and relevant metadata. So, to be precise, we need more than 300 TB per month, but for the sake of simplicity, let’s stick to the number 300 TB per month.

### Bandwidth estimation
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.

10 TB/86400sec≈926 Mb/s

```
Note: To keep our design simple, we’ve ignored the media content (images, videos, documents, and so on). So, the number 926 might seem low.
```
We also require an equal amount of outgoing bandwidth as the same message from the sender would need to be delivered to the receiver.

                   High-level Estimates
Type                                      Estimates

Total messages per day                   100 billion

Storage required per day                  10 TB

Storage for 30 days                       300 TB

Incoming data per second                  926 Mb/s

Outgoing data per second                  926 Mb/s

```

### Number of servers estimation
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server. However, it’s possible by extensive performance engineering. We’ll need to know all the in-depth details of a system, such as a server’s kernel, networking library, infrastructure configuration, and so on.
```
Note: We can often optimize a general-purpose server for special tasks by careful performance engineering of the full software stack.
```
Let’s move to the estimation of the number of servers:

No. of servers=Total connections per day/No. of connections per server=2 billion/10 million=200 servers

So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

### Try it out
Let’s analyze how the number of messages per day affects the storage and bandwidth requirements. For this purpose, we can change values in the following table to compute the estimates:

```
Number of users per day (in billions)	2
Number of messages per day (in billions)	100
Size of each message (in bytes)	100
Number of connections a server can handle (in millions)	10
Storage estimation per day (in TB)	10
Incoming and Outgoing bandwidth (Mb/s)	926.4
Number of chat servers required 200
```

## Building blocks we will use
The design of WhatsApp utilizes the following building blocks that have also been discussed in the initial chapters:

![The building blocks required to design WhatsApp](./bb.jpg)

- Databases are required to store users’ and groups’ metadata.
- Blob storage is used to store multimedia content shared in messages.
- A CDN is used to effectively deliver multimedia content that’s frequently shared.
- A load balancer distributes incoming requests among the pool of available servers.
- Caches are required to keep frequently accessed data used by various services.
- A messaging queue is used to temporarily keep messages in a queue on a database when a user is offline.
In the next lesson, we’ll focus on the high-level design of the WhatsApp messenger.


## How will we design WhatsApp?
We’ve divided the design of WhatsApp messenger into the following five lessons:

1. [Requirements](../Requirements%20of%20WhatsApp’s%20Design/): In this lesson, we’ll identify functional and non-functional requirements. We’ll also discuss resource estimations required for better and smooth operations of the proposed design of WhatsApp.
2. [High-level Design](../High-level%20Design%20of%20WhatsApp/): We’ll focus on the high-level design of our WhatsApp version. We’ll also discuss essential APIs for our WhatsApp design.
3. [Detailed Design](../Detailed%20Design%20of%20WhatsApp/): In this lesson, we’ll describe the design of our WhatsApp messenger in detail. Initially, we’ll explain the design of each microservice, including connection with servers, send and receive messages and media content, and group messages. In the end, the design of each microservice is combined into the detailed design of WhatsApp.
4. [Evaluation](../Evaluation%20of%20WhatsApp’s%20Design/): This lesson will explain how our version of WhatsApp fulfills non-functional requirements. We’ll also evaluate some trade-offs of our design.
5. [Quiz](../Quiz%20on%20WhatsApp’s%20Design/): Here, we’ll assess what we’ve learned in this chapter through a quiz.
Let’s start by discussing the requirements of our version of WhatsApp.
