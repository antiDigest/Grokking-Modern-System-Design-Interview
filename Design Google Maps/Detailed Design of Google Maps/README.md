# Detailed Design of Google Maps

In this lesson, we’ll discuss our detailed design by answering the following questions:

1. How do user requests benefit from segments?
2. How do we improve the user experience by increasing the accuracy of ETAs?

## Segment setup and request handling
This section will describe how the segment data is stored in the database and how user requests are handled using the already stored data.

Starting with the storage schema, we discuss how the segments are added and hosted on the servers and also how the user requests are processed.

### Storage schema
We store the following information for each segment:

**Key-value store:**

The segment’s ID.
The serverID on which the segment is hosted.
In reality, each segment is a polygon, so we store boundary coordinates (latitude/longitude), possibly as a list.
A list of segment IDs of the neighbors segments.

**Graph database**

The road network inside the segment in the form of a graph.

**Relational DB**

We store the information to determine whether, at a particular hour of the day, the roads are congested. This later helps us decide whether or not to update the graph (weights) based on the live data.

- edgeID identifies the edge.
- hourRange tells us which hour of the day it is when there are typical road conditions (non-rush hour) on the road.
- rush is a Boolean value that depicts whether there is congestion or not on a specific road at a specific time.

```
Note:segID, serverID, and edgeID are unique IDs generated by a uniqueID generator (see the Sequencer lessons for details).
```
### Design
The following illustration consists of two workflows. One adds segments to the map and hosts them on the severs, while the other shows how the user request to find a path between two points is processed.

**Add segment**

1. Each segment has its latitude/longitude boundary coordinates and the graph of its road network.
2. The segment adder processes the request to add the segment along with the segment information. The segment adder assigns a unique ID to each segment using a unique ID generator system.
3. After assigning the ID to the segment, the segment adder forwards the segment information to the server allocator.
4. The server allocator assigns a server to the segment, hosts that segment graph on that server, and returns the serverID to the segment adder.
5. After the segment is assigned to the server, the segment adder stores the segment to server mapping in the key-value store. It helps in finding the appropriate servers to process user requests. It also stores each segment’s boundary latitude/longitude coordinates in a separate key-value object.

**Handle the user’s request**

1. The user provides the source and the destination so that our service can find the path between them.
2. The latitude and longitude of the source and the destination are determined through a distributed search.
3. The latitude/longitude for the source and the destination are passed to the graph processing service that finds the segments in which the source and the destination latitude/longitude lie from the key-value store.
4. After finding the segment IDs, the graph processing service finds the servers that are hosting these segments from the key-value store.
5. The graph processing service connects to the relevant servers to find the shortest path between the source and the destination. If the source and the destination belong to the same segment, the graph processing service returns the shortest path by running the query only on a single segment. Otherwise, it will connect the segments from different servers, as we have seen in the previous lesson.

## Improve estimations using live data
This section describes how we can improve the ETA estimation accuracy using live data. If we have a sequence of location data for different devices, we can find movement patterns and perform analytics to predict various factors that may influence a user’s trip. Google Maps uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to track users’ locations. To collect this data, our maps system servers need to have a persistent connection with all the devices that have their location turned on. Below, we discuss the tools, techniques, and components involved in the process of improving estimations using live data.

- WebSocket is a communication protocol that allows users and servers to have a two-way, interactive communication session. This helps in the real-time transfer of data between user and server.

- The load balancer balances the connection load between different servers since there is a limit on the number of WebSocket connections per server. It connects some devices to server 1, some to server 2, and so on.

![Performing analytics on the live location data to keep the map up-to-date and also improve ETA estimations](./analysis.jpg)

- A pub-sub system collects the location data streams (device, time, location) from all servers. The location data from pub-sub is read by a data analytics engine like Apache Spark. The data analytics engine uses data science techniques—such as machine learning, clustering, and so on—to measure and predict traffic on the roads, identify gatherings, hotspots, events, find out new roads, and so on. These analytics help our system improve ETAs.
```
Note: The amount of traffic, road conditions, and hotspots directly affect average travel speed, which ultimately affects users’ ETAs.
```
- The data analytics engine publishes the analytics data to a new pub-sub topic.

- The map update service listens to the updates from the pub-sub topic for the analytics. It updates the segment graphs if there is a new road identified or if there is a change in the weight (average speed (traffic, road condition)) on the edges of the graph. Depending on the location, we know which segment the update belongs to. We find the routing server on which that segment is placed from the key-value store and update the graph on that server.

```
Question
Many traffic conditions are transitory (like stopping at a signal), so updating the graph very often wouldn’t scale well because it requires excessive processing. What could be the solution to this problem?

Answer
To detect transitory and normal conditions, we keep two copies of all relevant data (weights): one for normal conditions and the other for transitory conditions. That way, we won’t have to do excessive processing.
```

- The graph preprocessing service recalculates the new paths on the updated segment graph. We’ve seen how the paths are updated continuously in the background based on the live data.

We’ve learned how the segments work, how a user finds the location between two points, and how the ETA's accuracy is improved by utilizing the live location data.


## How will we design Google Maps?
We divide the design of Google Maps into five lessons:

1. [Requirements](../Requirements%20of%20Google%20Maps'%20Design/): In this lesson, we’ll list the functional and non-functional requirements of a Google Maps system. We will also identify the challenges involved in designing such a system. Lastly, we’ll estimate the resources like servers and bandwidth needed to serve queries by millions of users.
2. [Design](../Design%20of%20Google%20Maps/): This lesson consists of the high-level and API design of a system like Google maps. We’ll describe the services and the workflow of the system.
3. [Meeting the challenges](../Challenges%20of%20Google%20Maps'%20Design/): We will discuss how we overcome the challenges that we highlighted in the requirements lesson.
4. [Detailed design](../Detailed%20Design%20of%20Google%20Maps/): Based on the solution to the challenges, we will improve our earlier design and also elaborate on different aspects of it. We will describe the detailed design, including storage schema.
5. [Evaluation](../Evaluation%20of%20Google%20Maps'%20Design/): This lesson explains how our designed Google Maps system fulfills all the requirements.
Let’s start by understanding the requirements for designing a system like Google Maps.
