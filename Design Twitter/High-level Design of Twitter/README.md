# High-level Design of Twitter
## User-system interaction
Let’s begin with the high-level design of our Twitter system. We’ll initially highlight and discuss the building blocks, as well as other components, in the context of the Twitter problem briefly. Later on, we’ll dive deep into a few components in this chapter.

![Twitter components](./components.jpg)

- Users post Tweets delivered to the server through the load balancer. Then, the system stores it in persistent storage.

- DNS provides the specified IP address to the end user to start communication with the requested service.

- CDN is situated near the users to provide requested data with low latency. When users search for a specified term or tag, the system first searches in the CDN proxy servers containing the most frequently requested content.

- Load balancer chooses the operational application server based on traffic load on the available servers and the user requests.

- Storage system represents the various types of storage (SQL-based and NoSQL-based) in the above illustration. We’ll discuss significant storage systems later in this chapter.

- Application servers provide various services and have business logic to orchestrate between different components to meet our functional requirements.

We have detailed chapters on DNS, CDN, specified storage systems (Databases, Key-value store, Blob store), and Load balancers in our building blocks section. We’ll focus on further details specific to the Twitter service in the coming lessons. Let’s first understand the service API.

## API design
This section will focus on designing various APIs regarding the functionalities we are providing. We learn how users request various services through APIs. We’ll only concentrate on the significant parameters of the APIs that are relevant to our design. Although the front-end server can call another API or add more parameters in the API received from the end users to fulfill the given request, we consider all relevant arguments specified for the particular request in a single API. Let’s develop APIs for each of the following features:

- Post Tweet
- Like or dislike Tweet
- Reply to Tweet
- Search Tweet
- View user or home timeline
- Follow or unfollow the account
- Retweet a Tweet

### Post Tweet
The POST method is used to send the Tweet to the server from the user through the /postTweet API.
```
postTweet(user_id, access_type, tweet_type, content, tweet_length, media_field, list_of_followers, post_time, tweet_location, list_of_used_hashtags, list_of_tagged_people)

```
Let’s discuss a few of the parameters:
```
Parameter             Description

user_id               It indicates the unique ID of the user who posted the Tweet. 

access_type           It tells us whether the Tweet is protected (that is, only visible to followers) or public.

tweet_type            It indicates whether the Tweet is text-based, video-clip based, image(s)-based, or consisting of different types.

content               It specifies the Tweet’s actual content (text).

tweet_length          It represents the text length in the Tweet. In the case of video, it tells us the duration and size of a video. 

media_field           It specifies the type of media (image, video, GIF, and so on) delivered in each Tweet.

list_of_followers     It provides the current followers of the account posting the Tweet. This parameter is filled by the front-end server after it fetches this information using another API.

The rest of the parameters are self-explanatory.

```

```
Note: Twitter uses the Snowflake service to generate unique IDs for Tweets. We have a detailed chapter (Sequencer) that explains this service.
```

```
Question 1
At most, how many hashtags can a Tweet have?

Answer
The text limit is 280 characters in a Tweet. So, users can use the hashtag(s) such that text length (including plain text, any links, and hashtags) does not exceed the limit of 280 characters.
```

```
Question 2
What is the need for the list_of_tagged_people in the /postTweet API?

Answer
The system has to notify the people tagged in the Tweet.
```

### Like or dislike Tweet
The /likeTweet API is used when users like public Tweets.
```
likeTweet(user_id, tweet_id, tweeted_user_id, user_location)
```

```
Parameter           Description

user_id             It indicates the unique ID of the user who liked the Tweet.

tweet_id            It indicates the Tweet's unique ID.

tweeted_user_id     This is the unique ID of the user who posted the Tweet.

user_location       It denotes the location of the user who liked the Tweet.
```
The parameters above are also used in the /dislikeTweet API when users dislike others’ Tweets.

### Reply to Tweet
The /replyTweet API is used when users reply to public Tweets.
```
replyTweet(user_id, tweet_id, tweeted_user_id, reply_type, reply_length, ,list_of_followers)
```

```
Parameter              Description

list_of_followers      It specifies the list of user followers who replied to someone's Tweet.
```
The reply_type and reply_length parameters are the same as tweet_type and tweet_length respectively.

### Search Tweet
When the user searches any keyword in the home timeline, the GET method is used. The following is the /searchTweet API:
```
searchTweet(user_id, search_term, max_result, exclude, media_field, expansions, sort_order, next_token, user_location)
```
Some new parameters introduced in this case are:
```
Parameter             Description

search_term           It is a string containing the search keyword or phrase.

max_result            It is the number of Tweets returned per response page. By default, the Tweets per response is 10.

exclude               It specifies what to exclude from the returned Tweets, that is, replies and retweets. The maximum limit on returned Tweets is 3200, but when we exclude replies, the maximum limit is reduced to 800 Tweets.

media_field           It specifies the media (image, video, GIF) delivered in each returned Tweet.

expansions            It enables us to request additional data objects in the returned Tweets, such as any mentioned user, referenced Tweet, attached media, attached places objects, and so on.

sort_order            It specifies the order in which Tweets are returned. By default, it will return the most recent Tweets first.

next_token            It is used to get the next page of results. For instance, if max_result is set to 100 Tweets, and the result set contains 200 Tweets, then the value of next_token is directly pulled from the response to request the next page containing the following 100 Tweets. The last result (page) will not have a next_token.
```
#### Response
Let’s look at a sample response in JSON format. The id is the user’s unique ID who posted the Tweet and the text is the Tweet’s content. The result_count is the count of the returned Tweet, which we set in the max_result in the request. Here, we’re displaying the default fields only.

```json
{
  "data": ![
    {
      "id": "7300333948034441183",
      "text": "This is a most matched Tweet"
    },
    {
      "id": "6498431343154916376",
      "text": "This is next to most matched Tweet"
    },
                   : 
                   :
                   :
    {
      "id": "6427456107642019844",
      "text": "This is the last matched Tweet in the current page of the result.
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "newest_id": "7300333948034441183",
    "oldest_id": "6427456107642019844",
    "result_count": 10
  }
}
```

```
Note: Twitter performs various types of searches. The following are two of them:

One search type returns the result of the last seven days, which all registered users usually use.
The other type returns all matching results on all Tweets ever posted (remind that service does not delete a posted Tweet). Indeed, matches can contain the first Tweet on Twitter. This search is usually used for academic research.
```

### View home_timeline
The GET method is suitable when users view their home timelines through the /viewHome_timeline API.
```
viewHome_timeline(user_id, tweets_count, max_result, exclude, next_tokan, list_of_followers, user_location)
```
In the /viewUser_timeline API, we’ll exclude the list_of_followers and user_location to get the user timeline.

```
Question
Which parameter in the viewHome_timeline method is the most relevant when deciding which promoted ads (Tweets) to be returned in response?

Answer
The decision to send specified promoted ads is made on the user_location parameter. For example, the user belongs to the NewYork city, so most probably it gets promoted ads associated or originated in that region.
```

### Follow the account
The /followAccount API is used when users follow someone’s account on Twitter.
```
followAccount(account_id, followed_account_id,)
```

```
Parameter                Description

account_id               It specifies the unique ID of a user who follows that account on Twitter.

followed_account_id      It indicates the unique ID of the account that the user follows.
```
The /unfollowAccount API will use the same parameters when a user unfollows someone’s account on Twitter.

### Retweet a Tweet
When a registered user Retweets (re-posts) someone’s Tweet on Twitter, the following /retweet API is called:
```
retweet(user_id, tweet_id, retweet_user_id, list_of_followers)
```
The same parameters will be required in the /undoRetweet API when users undo a Retweet of someone’s Tweet.
