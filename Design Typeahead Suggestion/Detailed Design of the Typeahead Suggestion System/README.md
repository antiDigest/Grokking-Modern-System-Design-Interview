# Detailed Design of the Typeahead Suggestion System
## Detailed design
Let’s go over the flow and interaction of the components shown in the illustration below. Our design is divided into two main parts:

- A suggestion service
- An assembler

### Suggestion service
At the same time that a user types a query in the search box, the getSuggestions(prefix) API calls hit the suggestions services. The top ten popular queries are returned from the distributed cache, Redis.

### Assembler
In the previous lesson, we discussed how tries are built, partitioned, and stored in the database. However, the creation and updation of a trie shouldn’t come in the critical path of a user’s query. We shouldn’t update the trie in real time for the following reasons:

- There could be millions of users entering queries every second. During such phases with large amounts of incoming traffic, updating the trie in real time on every query can slow down our suggestion service.
- We have to provide top suggestions that might not frequently change after the creation or updation of the trie. So, it’s less important to update the trie frequently.
In light of the reasons given above, we have a separate service called an assembler that’s responsible for creating and updating tries after a certain configurable amount of time. The assembler consists of the following different services:

- Collection service: Whenever a user types, this service collects the log that consists of phrases, time, and other metadata and dumps it in a database that’s processed later. Since the size of this data is huge, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is considered a suitable storage system for storing this raw data.

```
               Raw Data Collected by the Collection Service
Phrases            Date and Time (DD-MM-YYYY  HH:MM:SS)

UNIVERSAL          23-03-2022 10:16:18

UNIVERSITY         23-03-2022 10:20:11

UNIQUE             23-03-2022 10:21:10

UNIQUE             23-03-2022 10:22:24

UNIVERSITY         23-03-2022 10:25:09
```

An example of the raw data from the collection service is shown in the following table. We record the time so that the system knows when to update the frequency of a certain phrase.

- Aggregator: The raw data collected by the collection service is usually not in a consolidated shape. We need to consolidate the raw data to process it further and to create or update the tries. An aggregator retrieves the data from the HDFS and distributes it to different workers. Generally, the MapReducer is responsible for aggregating the frequency of the prefixes over a given interval of time, and the frequency is updated periodically in the associated Cassandra database. Cassandra is suitable for this purpose because it can store large amounts of data in a tabular format.

The following table shows the processed and consolidated data within a particular period. This table is updated regularly by the aggregator and is stored in a hash table in a database like Cassandra. For simplicity, we assume that our data is case insensitive.

```
   Useful Information Extracted from the Raw Data
Phrases               Frequency           Time Interval

UNIVERSAL             1400                1st 15 minutes

UNIVERSITY            1340                1st 15 minutes

UNIQUE                1200                1st 15 minutes

```

- Trie builder: This service is responsible for creating or updating tries. It stores these new and updated tries on their respective shards in the trie database via ZooKeeper. Tries are stored in persistent storage in a file so that we can rebuild our trie easily if necessary. NoSQL document databases such as MongoDB are suitable for storing these tries. This storage of a trie is needed when a machine restarts.

The trie is updated from the aggregated data in the Cassandra database. The existing snapshot of a trie is updated with all the new terms and their corresponding frequencies. Otherwise, a new trie is created using the data in the Cassandra database.

Once a trie is created or updated, the system makes it available for the suggestion service.

```
Question
Should we collect data and build a trie per user, or should it be shared among all users?

Answer
Since we aim to design a system on a scale that’s similar to Google Search, billions of users will be using our service. Since the number of users would be huge, maintaining a tree for each user would become complex and time-consuming. There’s also a possibility of duplicated trees if several users have typed some common searches, resulting in resource wastage.

Therefore, our design assumes a common trie that’s shared among users, where the ranking would be based on single phrases in the trie and the frequency of the terms.
```

## How will we design a typeahead suggestion system?
We’ve divided the chapter on the design of the typeahead suggestion system into six lessons:

1. [Requirements](../Requirements%20of%20the%20Typeahead%20Suggestion%20System’s%20Design/): In this lesson, we focus on the functional and non-functional requirements for designing a typeahead suggestion system. We also discuss resource estimations for the smooth operation of the system.
2. [High-level design](../High-level%20Design%20of%20the%20Typeahead%20Suggestion%20System/): In this lesson, we discuss the high-level design of our version of the typeahead suggestion system. We also discuss some essential APIs used in the design.
3. [Data Structure for Storing Prefixes](../Data%20Structure%20for%20Storing%20Prefixes/): In this lesson, we cover an efficient tree data structure called trie that’s used to store search prefixes. We also discuss how it can be further optimized to reduce the tree traversal time.
4. [Detailed design](../Detailed%20Design%20of%20the%20Typeahead%20Suggestion%20System/): In this lesson, we explain the two main components, the suggestions service and the assembler, which make up the detailed design of the typeahead suggestion system.
5. [Evaluation](../Evaluation%20of%20the%20Typeahead%20Suggestion%20System’s%20Design/): This lesson evaluates the proposed design of the typeahead suggestion system based on the non-functional requirements of the system. It also presents some client-side optimization and personalization that could significantly affect the system’s design.
6. [Quiz](../Quiz%20on%20the%20Typeahead%20Suggestion%20System’s%20Design/): In this lesson, we assess our understanding of the design via a quiz.
Let’s start by identifying the requirements for designing a typeahead suggestion system.
