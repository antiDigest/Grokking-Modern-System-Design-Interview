# Requirements of Instagram’s Design
## Requirements
We’ll concentrate on some important features of Instagram to make this design simple. Let’s list down the requirements for our system:

### Functional requirements
- Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.

- Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.

- Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.

- Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.

- Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow. Users can also view suggested and promoted photos in their news feed.

### Non-functional requirements
- Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.

- Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.

- Availability: The system should be highly available.

- Durability Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.

- Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.

- eliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

## Resource estimation
Our system is read-heavy because service users spend substantially more time browsing the feeds of others than creating and posting new content. Our focus will be to design a system that can fetch the photos and videos on time. There is no restriction on the number of photos or videos that users can upload, meaning efficient storage management should be a primary consideration in the design of this system. Instagram supports around a billion users globally who share 95 million photos and videos on Instagram per day. We’ll calculate the resources and design our system based on the requirements.

Let’s assume the following:

- We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users.

- Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day.

- We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.

- On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

### Storage estimation
We need to estimate the storage capacity, bandwidth, and the number of servers to support such an enormous number of users and content.

The storage per day will be:

60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day

35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day

Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB

The total space required for a year:

5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

![Total storage required by the Instagram storage system for a year](./storage.jpg)

Besides photos and videos, we have ignored comments, status sharing data, and so on. Moreover, we also have to store users’ information and post metadata, for example, userID, photo, and so on. So, to be precise, we need more than 5430 TB/day, but to keep our design simple, let’s stick to the 5430 TB/day.

### Bandwidth estimation
According to the estimate of our storage capacity, our service will get 5430 TB of data each day, which will give us:

5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

Since each incoming photo and video needs to reach the users’ followers, let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1. As a result, we need 100 times more bandwidth than incoming bandwidth. Let’s assume the following:

Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps

Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

![Total bandwidth required](./bandwidth.jpg)

### Number of servers estimation
We need to handle concurrent requests coming from 500 million daily active users. Let’s assume that a typical Instagram server handles 100 requests per second:

Requests by each user per day = 20 Queries handled by a server per second = 100

Queries handled by a server per day = 100 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 8640000

Number of active users∗Requests by each user per day / Queries handled per server a day=1157 servers approx

This calculation shows that we need 1157 servers to handle queries in our Instagram system.

## Try it yourself
Let’s analyze how the number of photos per day affects the storage and bandwidth requirements. For this purpose, try to change values in the following table to compute the estimates. We have set 20 requests by each user per day in the following calculation:

```
          Requirements 	Calculations
Number of photos per day (in millions)              60
Size of each photo (in MB)                           3
Number of videos per day (in millions)              35
Size of each video (in MB)                          150
Number of daily active users (in millions)          500
Number of requests a server can handle per day	8640000
Storage estimation per day (in TB)                 5430
Incoming bandwidth (Gb/s)                          502.8
Number of servers needed                           1157
```

## Building blocks we will use
In the next lesson, we’ll focus on the high-level design of Instagram. The design will utilize many building blocks that have been discussed in the initial chapters also. We’ll use the following building blocks in our design:

![Building blocks used in Instagram design](./bb.jpg)

- A load balancer at various layers will ensure smooth requests distribution among available servers.
- A database is used to store the user and accounts metadata and relationship among them.
- Blob storage is needed to store the various types of content such as photos, videos, and so on.
- A task scheduler schedules the events on the database such as removing the entries whose time to live exceeds the limit.
- A cache stores the most frequent content related requests.
- CDN is used to effectively deliver content to end-users which reduces delay and burden on end-servers.
In the next lesson, we’ll discuss the high-level design of the Instagram system.
