# Requirements of a Distributed Messaging Queue’s Design
## Requirements
In a distributed messaging queue, data resides on several machines. Our aim is to design a distributed messaging queue that has the following functional and non-functional requirements.

### Functional requirements
- Listed below are the actions that a client should be able to perform:

- Queue creation: The client should be able to create a queue and set some parameters—for example, queue name, queue size, and maximum message size.

- Send message: Producer entities should be able to send messages to a queue that’s intended for them.

- Receive message: Consumer entities should be able to receive messages from their respective queues.

- Delete message: The consumer processes should be able to delete a message from the queue after a successful processing of the message.

- Queue deletion: Clients should be able to delete a specific queue.
```
A queue size is the maximum number of messages a queue can contain. For example, Amazon’s standard queue size is unlimited. However, for inflight messages, the size is limited to 120,000.

Generally, most popular services like Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Microsoft Messaging Queue (MSMQ) allow a maximum size of 256KB and 4MB, respectively.

How do we send messages larger than the predefined size?

Various approaches are used to send messages larger than the specified allowed size. For example, one approach is to divide the message into small chunks at the sender’s side and combine it at the receiver’s side. However, this approach incurs extra complexity on both the sender and receiver sides.

Amazon SQS provides extended libraries through which a user can send a message containing a reference to a message payload in Amazon S3 by making calls to several APIs, including AmazonSQSExtendedClient, ExtendedClientConfiguration, and so on. Similarly, Microsoft MSMQ provides an MQSendLargeMessage API to send a larger message than 4MB as an XML document.

Therefore, we will overlook this discussion by assuming that our system supports one of the strategies followed by Amazon or Microsoft.

```
## Non-functional requirements
Our design of a distributed messaging queue should adhere to the following non-functional requirements:

- Durability: The data received by the system should be durable and shouldn’t be lost. Producers and consumers can fail independently, and a queue with data durability is critical to make the whole system work, because other entities are relying on the queue.

- Scalability: The system needs to be scalable and capable of handling the increased load, queues, producers, consumers, and the number of messages. Similarly, when the load reduces, the system should be able to shrink the resources accordingly.

- Availability: The system should be highly available for receiving and sending messages. It should continue operating uninterrupted, even after the failure of one or more of its components.

- Performance: The system should provide high throughput and low latency.

## Single-server messaging queue
Before we embark on our journey to map out the design of a distributed messaging queue, we should recall how queues are used within a single server where the producer and consumer processes are also on the same node. A producer or consumer can access a single-server queue by acquiring the locking mechanism to avoid data inconsistency. The queue is considered a critical section where only one entity, either the producer or consumer, can access the data at a time.

However, several aspects restrain us from using the single-server messaging queue in today’s distributed systems paradigm. For example, it becomes unavailable to cooperating processes, producers and consumers, in the event of hardware or network failures. Moreover, performance takes a major hit as contention on the lock increases. Furthermore, it is neither scalable nor durable.

```
Such a queue is also called a bounded queue, due to its fixed size within the system.

## Building blocks we will use
The design of a distributed messaging queue utilizes the following building blocks:

- Database(s) will be required to store the metadata of queues and users.
- Caches are important to keep frequently accessed data, whether it be data pertaining to users or queues metadata.
- Load balancers are used to direct incoming requests to servers where the metadata is stored.
In our discussion on messaging queues, we focused on their functional and non-functional requirements. Before moving on to the process of designing a distributed messaging queue, it’s essential for us to discuss some key considerations and challenges that may affect the design.




## How do we design a distributed messaging queue?
We divide the design of a distributed messaging queue into the following five lessons:

1. [Requirements](../Requirements%20of%20a%20Distributed%20Messaging%20Queue’s%20Design/): Here, we focus on the functional and non-functional requirements of designing a distributed messaging queue. We also discuss a single server messaging queue and its drawbacks in this lesson.
2. [Design consideration](../Considerations%20of%20a%20Distributed%20Messaging%20Queue’s%20Design/): In this lesson, we discuss some important factors that may affect the design of a distributed messaging queue—for example, the order of placing messages in a queue, their extraction, their visibility in the queue, and the concurrency of incoming messages.
3. [Design: Part 1](../Design%20of%20a%20Distributed%20Messaging%20Queue%20Part%201/): In this lesson, we discuss the design of a distributed messaging queue in detail. We also describe the process of replication of queues and the interaction between various building blocks involved in the design.
4. [Design: Part 2](../Design%20of%20a%20Distributed%20Messaging%20Queue%20Part%202/): In this lesson, we discuss the design of a distributed messaging queue in detail. We also describe the process of replication of queues and the interaction between various building blocks involved in the design.
5. [Evaluation](../Evaluation%20of%20a%20Distributed%20Messaging%20Queue’s%20Design/): In this lesson, we evaluate the design of a distributed messaging queue based on its functional and non-functional requirements.
6. [Quiz](../Quiz%20on%20the%20Distributed%20Messaging%20Queue’s%20Design/): At the end of the chapter, we evaluate understanding of the design of a distributed messages queue via a quiz.
Let’s start by understanding the requirements of designing a distributed messaging queue.
